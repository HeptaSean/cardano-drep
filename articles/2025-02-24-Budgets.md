# Fundamental Critcism of the Cardano/Intersect Budget Process
I've tried it months ago in [https://forum.cardano.org/t/shaping-cardanos-future-a-deep-dive-into-the-2025-budget-process/138515/4](https://forum.cardano.org/t/shaping-cardanos-future-a-deep-dive-into-the-2025-budget-process/138515/4) without ever getting the promised answer and in discussions in the (horribly chaotic) Intersect Discord server, so I'm trying it again:

## Net Change Limit
The Intersect Budget Committee claims that they interviewed “experts” to come up with their proposal for a net change limit of 350 MADA in [https://forum.cardano.org/t/net-change-limit/143118](https://forum.cardano.org/t/net-change-limit/143118).

So, let's look at the data. Check out @werkof's excellent thread [https://xcancel.com/C1cADA_Markus/status/1636023354334347265](https://xcancel.com/C1cADA_Markus/status/1636023354334347265) on how reserves, treasury et al. work together.

The creation of this table is implemented in [2025-02-24-Treasury-History.py](https://github.com/HeptaSean/cardano-drep/articles/2025-02-24-Treasury-History.py).

The reserve and treasury values at the beginning of the epochs are taken from [https://api.koios.rest/#get-/totals](https://api.koios.rest/#get-/totals). For Epoch 240, the reserve is corrected by the withdrawals from [https://api.koios.rest/#get-/reserve_withdrawals](https://api.koios.rest/#get-/reserve_withdrawals) to get a view closer to what happens due to the regular operation of the chain.

The treasury withdrawals are taken from [https://api.koios.rest/#get-/treasury_withdrawals](https://api.koios.rest/#get-/treasury_withdrawals). For each year, those have to be added to the net increase of the treasury to get the real inflow to the treasury in that year.

The percentages are percentages of the reserves at the beginning of the year. Observe that the depletion of the reserves is much slower than the theoretical maximum depletion of 100% – 99.7%^73 = 19.69% would be. On the other hand, this leads to a slightly larger treasury inflow (since later in the year more of the reserves are left and used as input for the pots from which the treasury gets 20% each epoch). The transaction fees also play a role, although a very minor one.

Based on the treasury inflow of around 4% of the reserves at the beginning of each year, I project an inflow of 4% × 7.5 GADA = 300 MADA (even a little less) for 2025. So, the guesstimate of 350 MADA by the Intersect Budget Committee is already too high to serve their stated goal of at least preserving the current treasury stock.

**I am going to vote “No” on any net change limit higher than 300 MADA.**

I urge every dRep – especially those that have pledged to pursue a conservative approach on treasury spendings – to consider similar red lines.

Based on an assumed reserve depletion of 11.5% and again a treasury inflow of 4% per year, a net change limit of 300 MADA would lead to the following development over the next eight years (two cycles if you believe in cycles):

Of course, we will probably adapt the net change limit in these years. Maybe, we get enough of a bull market that a lot less is needed. Maybe, some larger development projects that are defined well enough are needed that justify taking more from the substance. Maybe, ADA establishes a higher low in the next bear market, so that we are comfortable with less capital stock in the treasury. …

## Treasury Withdrawals

## “Budgets”

## Compromise?
