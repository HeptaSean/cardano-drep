I don't think that they are worth our ADA and greenlighting that budget that combines a lot of different proposals could (and I fear will) be seen as a precedence that they then also have the 'right' to get those ADA in later treasury withdrawals. Large omnibus budgets were a phenomenally bad idea and the 'budget committee' was not open to change paths at all."
