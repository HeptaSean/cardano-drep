As discussed in detail in https://forum.cardano.org/t/fundamental-critcism-of-the-budget-process/143519#p-367722-net-change-limit-2, the treasury will almost certainly only grow by roughly 300 million ADA in 2025 and I don't want to start spending from the treasury stock yet. It is true that the methodology employed by the 'budget committee' now after a lot of questions would prevent unlimited spending â€“ it will go down to this year's earnings next year *if* they continue to use that methodology. But the genesis of this proposal sets a bad precedent on how to go about such matters."
