        "comment": "I'm voting 'No' on 'Defining the Cardano Vision and Roadmap for 2025 and beyond' for several reasons. 1. Formal: The Info action references a mutable document that may change at any time. This is not how on-chain voting should work. 2. Method: The action states that it wants to gather feedback by iterating during the lifetime of the action. This didn't happen and it also seems like a rather chaotic plan. 3. Content: It is unclear to me if a Yes would mean that everything on the roadmap and nothing that is not on the roadmap will be done. That would be too strict for my taste. I think some of the things on it are not that interesting and some are missing. But just a 'more or less okay' would not need a governance action. Hence: No."
