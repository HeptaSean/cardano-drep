There *were* a lot of proposals for a leaner and less ambiguous constitution. Although there were a lot of workshops and the constitutional convention, they side-lined all requests for larger changes and only allowed minor corrections. This was all just done for the marketing, not to actually come up with a good constitution. No to this!"
