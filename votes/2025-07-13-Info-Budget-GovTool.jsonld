This budget is *much* too large for the little that has been delivered so far and especially in comparison to other tools that provide the same, often even better functionality in governance portals as well as just as additional functionality of wallet apps. It's just not worth it. This is an example of a project that has grown *way* out of reasonable proportion when everything was centralised at IOG and Intersect. Let's scratch that!"
